#### Dev notes

This is a starter app of the original websockets implementation from Multiuser Fluid:  
[https://glitch.com/edit/#!/multiuser-fluid](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/multiuser-fluid)

I like this version for its simplicity with very minimal code in JSON format, while still supporting an event-based message structure for larger applications.

Hope to see people remixing this so we can see more creative websocket sites!
